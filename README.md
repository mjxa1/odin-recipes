# This is my Odin Recipes project. 

In this project i will create a basic recipe website.

The purpose of this project is to exercise the basics of html that I have learned so, such as:
    -laying out headers and paragraphs
    -utilizing ordered and unordered lists
    -embedding images
    -navigating to other pages on the site
